# Driver for simple hardware push buttons

This arduino script reads input signals from simple push buttons connected to the arduino and is compatible with the [Keyboard Connection Script](https://github.com/accessible-virtual-keyboard/inputdrivers/tree/master/arduino/arduino_keyboard_connection).

## Installation

Open the sketch in the Arduino IDE and upload it to your arduino. The buttons must be connected to the arduino so that the signal is HIGH when the buttons are pressed.
