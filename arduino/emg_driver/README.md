# Driver for the MyoWare Muscle Sensors

This arduino script reads input signals from the MyoWare Muscle Sensors and is compatible with the [Keyboard Connection Script](https://github.com/accessible-virtual-keyboard/inputdrivers/tree/master/arduino/arduino_keyboard_connection).

## Installation

Open the sketch in the Arduino IDE and upload it to your arduino. You also need to connect the MyoWare Muscle Sensors to the arduino. Instruction for the MyoWare sensors can be found [here](https://github.com/accessible-virtual-keyboard/inputdrivers/blob/master/arduino/emg_driver/emg_sensor_manual.pdf).
